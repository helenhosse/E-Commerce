# E-Commerce

## Description

In this challenge, we were give a functional API, and we needed to add it to a database by using Sequelize. You will enter the schema and seed commands and the database is created and seeded with the test data. You will then open the API through a GET route in Insomnia. Then you will have to test the POST, PUT and DELETE routes in Insomnia 

## User Story

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Installation

You will need to make sure you install all the dependencies through npm install. You will then need to create a .env file to store your MySQL information. You will then need to source your schema, then run your seed and start the app.
